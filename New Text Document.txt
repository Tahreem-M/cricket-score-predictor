# 🏏 Cricket Score Predictor

A Machine Learning web application that predicts the final score of a cricket innings
based on powerplay statistics and venue data.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies regression-based machine learning on a cricket dataset to predict
the final innings score. Two models are compared: Linear Regression and Random Forest.

---

## 📊 Dataset

| Feature | Description | Range |
|---|---|---|
| PP_Runs | Runs scored in powerplay | 30 – 70 |
| PP_Wkts | Wickets lost in powerplay | 0 – 3 |
| Venue_Avg | Average score at the venue | 140 – 190 |
| Final_Score | Target: Final innings total | 120 – 210 |

- Total records: 120
- No missing values

---

## 🤖 Models Used

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R² Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linear Regression | 4.40 | 5.30 | 0.94 |
| Random Forest | 4.29 | 6.06 | 0.92 |

**Winner: Linear Regression** (higher R² on this dataset)
